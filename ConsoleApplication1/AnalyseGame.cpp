Coding task

The game of Tic-Tac-Toe, or Noughts and Crosses, is played on a 3x3 grid by two players, one represented by a cross (X) and the other by a nought (O). One player goes first then they 
take it in turns to place their symbol on an unoccupied square on the grid. The first player to connect three of their symbols in a line either horizontally, vertically or diagonally 
is the winner. If there are no unoccupied squares left, the game is a draw.

Using C++, write a function which examines a Tic-Tac-Toe board and determines whether the first player won, the second player won or if the game is a draw. Also provide an adequate set
of tests to prove that the function works correctly.

The arguments to the function should be a suitable representation of the Tic-Tac-Toe board and it should return a value of a suitable type indicating the game state.
